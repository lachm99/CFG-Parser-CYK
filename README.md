# CFG-Parser-CYK
A simple python project based upon the CYK dynamic programming algorithm for parsing context free grammars.

The project can solve a number of problems:
1. Membership - Determines which strings (from an input list) can be generated by a provided Grammar.
2. Rightmost Derivation - Produce a rightmost derivation (where one exists) for a given string from a provided Grammar.
3. Ambiguity - Determines which strings (from an input list) are "ambiguous" in a provided Grammar.
